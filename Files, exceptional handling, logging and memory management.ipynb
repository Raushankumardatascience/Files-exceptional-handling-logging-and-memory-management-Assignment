What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- **Interpreted Languages**:\n","  - Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.\n","  - No separate compilation step; source code is directly executed.\n","  - Examples: Python, JavaScript.\n","  - Pros: Easier debugging, platform-independent, dynamic typing.\n","  - Cons: Slower execution due to runtime interpretation.\n","- **Compiled Languages**:\n","  - Code is translated into machine code (binary) by a compiler before execution.\n","  - Requires a compilation step, producing an executable file.\n","  - Examples: C, C++.\n","  - Pros: Faster execution, optimized code.\n","  - Cons: Platform-specific binaries, longer development cycle.\n","\n","**Key Differences**:\n","- **Execution**: Interpreted languages run directly; compiled languages require pre-compilation.\n","- **Speed**: Compiled languages are generally faster.\n","- **Debugging**: Interpreted languages allow easier runtime modifications.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- Exception handling is a mechanism to manage errors during program execution, preventing crashes and allowing graceful recovery.\n","- Uses `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions (runtime errors like `ZeroDivisionError`).\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","Cannot divide by zero!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- The `finally` block executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or is caught.\n","- Used for cleanup tasks (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n","    content = file.read()\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(\"File not found!\")\n","finally:\n","    print(\"Closing file...\")\n","    file.close()\n","```\n","\n","**Output** (if file doesn’t exist):\n","```\n","File not found!\n","Closing file...\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. What is logging in Python?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- Logging is a mechanism to record events, errors, or debugging information during program execution.\n","- Uses the `logging` module to generate logs with customizable levels, formats, and destinations (e.g., console, files).\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","import logging\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","INFO:root:This is an info message\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- The `__del__` method is a destructor, called when an object is about to be destroyed by the garbage collector.\n","- Used for cleanup (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).\n","- Not guaranteed to run immediately due to Python’s garbage collection.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","class MyClass:\n","    def __del__(self):\n","        print(\"Object is being deleted\")\n","obj = MyClass()\n","del obj\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","Object is being deleted\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6.

What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- **`try`**: Encloses code that might raise an exception.\n","- **`except`**: Catches and handles specific exceptions raised in the `try` block.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"Caught division by zero\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","Caught division by zero\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- Python uses **reference counting** and a **cyclic garbage collector**:\n","  - **Reference Counting**: Each object has a reference count. When it reaches zero, the object is deallocated.\n","  - **Cyclic Garbage Collector**: Detects and collects objects with cyclic references (e.g., objects referencing each other).\n","  - Enabled via the `gc` module, runs periodically or when triggered.\n","- **Generational Approach**: Objects are grouped into generations; newer objects are checked more frequently.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","import gc\n","class Node:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.self_ref = self  # Cyclic reference\n","obj = Node()\n","del obj\n","gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection\n","print(\"Garbage collected\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","Garbage collected\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 16.

What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- The `logging` module defines:\n","  - **DEBUG** (10): Detailed information for debugging.\n","  - **INFO** (20): General program flow information.\n","  - **WARNING** (30): Potential issues (default level).\n","  - **ERROR** (40): Serious errors affecting functionality.\n","  - **CRITICAL** (50): Fatal errors causing program termination.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","import logging\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n","logging.debug(\"Debug message\")\n","logging.info(\"Info message\")\n","logging.warning(\"Warning message\")\n","logging.error(\"Error message\")\n","logging.critical(\"Critical message\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","DEBUG:root:Debug message\n","INFO:root:Info message\n","WARNING:root:Warning message\n","ERROR:root:Error message\n","CRITICAL:root:Critical message\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- **`os.fork()`**:\n","  - Creates a new process by duplicating the current process (Unix-based systems only).\n","  - Child process inherits memory and state, sharing resources.\n","  - Low-level, manual process management.\n","- **`multiprocessing`**:\n","  - Python’s high-level module for creating and managing processes.\n","  - Each process has its own memory space, avoiding GIL issues.\n","  - Cross-platform, easier to use with abstractions like `Process` and `Pool`.\n","\n","**Key Differences**:\n","- **Platform**: `os.fork()` is Unix-only; `multiprocessing` is cross-platform.\n","- **Ease of Use**: `multiprocessing` provides higher-level APIs.\n","- **Memory**: `os.fork()` shares memory initially; `multiprocessing` isolates memory.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- Closing files releases system resources (file descriptors).\n","- Prevents memory leaks and ensures data is flushed to disk.\n","- Avoids file corruption or access issues in long-running programs.\n","- The `with` statement automates this process.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n","    file.write(\"Hello\")\n","# File is automatically closed\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- **`file.read()`**:\n","  - Reads the entire file content into a single string.\n","  - Optional argument specifies number of characters to read.\n","- **`file.readline()`**:\n","  - Reads one line at a time, up to the newline character (`\\n`).\n","  - Returns empty string at end-of-file.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","# Simulate file content\n","with open('example.txt', 'w') as f:\n","    f.write(\"Line 1\\nLine 2\")\n","with open('example.txt', 'r') as f:\n","    print(\"read():\", f.read())\n","with open('example.txt', 'r') as f:\n","    print(\"readline():\", f.readline())\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","read(): Line 1\n","Line 2\n","readline(): Line 1\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 21.
